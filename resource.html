            <p class="opening"> In Africa, computer proficiency is disproportionately low due to a variety of factors such as limited resources, inadequate <br> infrastructure, and a shortage of professionals. This is highlighted by reports such as the World Economic Forum Network's <br> Global Information Technology Reports, where the first African country, South Africa, appears in 68th place, and last place went to Chad. <br> The lack of accessibility to resources poses a significant barrier to individuals looking to enter the field of computer science, <br> which is rapidly growing in demand and popularity. To address this issue, I have compiled series of websites that provides <br> and teachers users how to code and program. By doing so, I hope to encourage individuals in Africa and other parts of the world <br> looking to pursue computer science.</p>
